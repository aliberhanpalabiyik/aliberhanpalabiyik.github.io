            <p>
                I use this space for short reflections on studying mathematics, problem solving,
                and sometimes on life as an undergraduate student. Posts are informal and mostly
                meant for myself and friends.

                    <strong>Why I enjoy analysis</strong><br>
                    <span class="muted">November 2025</span><br>
                    A few thoughts on why I prefer analysis and topology over more combinatorial
                    topics, and how continuous objects feel more natural to me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Learning to write proofs</strong><br>
                    <span class="muted">November 2025</span><br>
                    Notes on how I try to structure my proofs, avoid common mistakes, and how
                    I deal with getting stuck on problem sheets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Balancing courses and self-study</strong><br>
                    <span class="muted">October 2025</span><br>
                    Some comments on keeping a weekly schedule that includes problem sets,
                    revision, and reading ahead.
                </li>

                Later I can move each post into its own HTML file (or Markdown-generated page)
                and link them from here.
